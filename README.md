# PinOne — Open Source Microcontroller Platform

PinOne is a compact, minimalist, and open-source family of microcontroller boards designed for creative, educational, and experimental electronics projects. Developed with simplicity, versatility, and approachability in mind, PinOne aims to make microcontroller use and prototyping accessible — whether you're building for yourself, gifting, or simply learning.

## Project Goals
- Provide small, easy-to-use, and hackable boards.
- Encourage personal use, customization, and open-source collaboration.
- Enable straightforward programming with tools like Arduino IDE.
- Explore unique hardware forms (USB, SD card, and more).

## Current Focus
- **PinOne Base (P1)**: Core USB-based microcontroller board.
  - Versions: V1.0 (Unavilable), V1.1 (corrected), V2.0 (smaller + USB-C + more pins).
  - Based on the ATtiny85 microcontroller.

## Repository Structure
- `pcb/` – Board designs, schematics, and Gerber files (V1.0–V2.0).
- `firmware/` – Example code for PinOne (e.g., LED blink, I/O tests). (to be added)
- `LICENSE` – Open-source license (e.g., MIT or CERN-OHL).
- `README.md` – This overview file.


## Status
PinOne is actively being developed. Contributions, feedback, and forks are welcome — this is a personal learning and community-building project.

## Why PinOne?
As a student-driven idea, PinOne blends learning and real-world prototyping. These boards are meant to be shared, modified, and enjoyed — with no expectation to sell or profit from them.
